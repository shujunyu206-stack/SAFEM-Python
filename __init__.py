"""SAFEM Python port.

This package is a structural translation of the MATLAB SAFEM scripts/functions
from the provided archive.

Notes:
- Units follow the MATLAB code (typically m, Pa, s) unless stated otherwise.
- Exact numerical agreement requires matching the original mesh generation and
  boundary/interface assumptions.
